It is also why it works even if your mirror sits on a backsplash or runs into a wall. The frame tapes onto the glass with professional grade, double-side 3M tape - guaranteed to last in the bath. If your mirror is attached with clips, no worries! There is a recess in the back of the frame that allows it to fit over the clips. No other frame or store-bought trim has this!<\/p>"}},"information_PdVpBf":{"type":"information","settings":{"title":"How does the frame attach to the mirror?","infos":"<p>The frame is pre-taped with professional-grade 3M tape and guaranteed to last in the bath.<\/p>"}},"information_ArQQhf":{"type":"information","settings":{"title":"What is the frame made of?","infos":"<p>The vast majority of our frames are made of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard), an environmentally-responsible, strong, non-warping wood-base.

Each product page provides the exact base composite of that style.<\/p>"}},"information_NnbWap":{"type":"information","settings":{"title":"Why should I buy a MirrorMate frame instead of a complete framed mirror?","infos":"<p>MirrorMate frames are less expensive than most new framed mirrors and they don't require that you remove your existing mirror. This is especially good news if your existing mirrors are glued to the wall, since removing them may damage the wall, and if they break, may cause injury. The additional time and cost of repairing the wall, plus disposal of mirrors into a landfill make MirrorMate frames even more cost-effective. MirrorMate frames are easy to install, requiring no special tools or skills. They work with any rectangular-shaped mirror and are available in a variety of styles to fit any decor.<\/p>"}},"information_ntyhkh":{"type":"information","settings":{"title":"Will I see the mirror edge under the frame from the side?","infos":"<p>Where there is space we extend the frame beyond the mirror up to 5\/8 inch - to create the illusion that the raw edge of the mirror is covered. If your mirror has zero clearance on a side then we do not extend the frame on that side and the frame will be flush with the edge of the mirror.
